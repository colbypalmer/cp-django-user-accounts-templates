# Templates for use with django-user-accounts

These are some basic templates for use with https://github.com/pinax/django-user-accounts.

They are based on the Pinax bootstrap template files, but customized to work with my own project template: https://github.com/colbypalmer/cp-project-template

Version: 0.1.0

Quick start
-----------

Install and configure django-user-accounts.

Drop the `accounts` folder into your `templates` directory.
